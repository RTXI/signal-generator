### Signal Generator

**Requirements:** Generator class (included)  
**Limitations:** none noted

<!--start-->
This module generates the following signals:  
1. Sine Wave: needs frequency and amplitude  
2. Monophasic Square Wave: needs delay, width, and amplitude  
3. Biphasic Square Wave: needs delay, width, and amplitude  
4. Sawtooth Wave: needs delay, width, and maximum amplitude  
5. ZAP Stimulus: needs starting and ending frequencies, amplitude, and duration of ZAP  

All the signals are continuous except for the ZAP stimulus, which has a specified duration. Only the relevant parameters are used to generate the waveforms.

#### Output Channels
1. output(0) – “Signal Waveform”  

#### Parameters
1. Delay : in seconds  
2. Width : in seconds  
3. Freq (Hz) : frequency of sine wave, also the starting frequency for ZAP stimulus  
4. Amplitude  
5. ZAP max Freq (Hz) : maximum frequency for ZAP stimulus  
6. ZAP duration (s)
